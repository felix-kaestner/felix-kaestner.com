I am a software developer specialized in mobile and ubiquitous computing. I live in Dresden where I study Computer Science at [Technische Universität Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de), currently working towards my Master’s Degree.

Since the end of 2019 I am a lead front-end developer for the [Movebis](https://www.movebis.org) visualization toolkit. Besides, I currently work on developing mobile applications (mostly Android) together with my good friend [Philipp Matthes](https://philippmatth.es). We are currently prototyping [PeerBridge](https://github.com/peerbridge) an anonymous messenger based on Blockchain and DPoS. Additionally, we are rebuilding the [OUTPUT.DD](https://output-dd.de) [Apps](https://github.com/output-dd).

I am currently employed at [MARKENZOO](https://markenzoo.de), where I work as a web developer, creating and maintaining a variety of different projects mainly focused around [Contao CMS](https://contao.org).

I strive to learn new things and develop skills in a range of different areas. If you have an interesting project or want to ask me anything, you can reach out and send me a [mail](mailto:hello@felix-kaestner.com). You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaestner_felix) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-kaestner).

Fun fact: I am the winner of the 1st Thuringian Computer Science Competition.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing strength training and I am a coffee lover!
